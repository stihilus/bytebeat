## What is Bytebeat?

Bytebeat is a method of creating audio by using short algorithms that produce samples directly. Each sample is generated by evaluating a mathematical expression, usually involving the sample index (traditionally represented as `t`). The result of this expression is then interpreted as an audio sample.
